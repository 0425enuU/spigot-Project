Subject: [PATCH] Configurable Amount of Netty Threads

This brings back the option that the Spigot version of netty saw. By default Netty will try and use cores*2 threads, however if running multiple servers on the same machine, this can be too many threads. Additionally some people have 16 core servers. If 32 Netty threads are allowed in this setup, then the lock contention, and thus blocking between threads becomes much greater, leading to decreased performance.
